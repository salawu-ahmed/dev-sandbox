# Ecommerce CSS Practice Guide

This repository is designed to help you build **speed, confidence, and pattern recognition** in CSS using real-world ecommerce UI components.

Follow the rules below strictly to get the most value from the drills.

---

## ✅ How to Practice

### 1. Daily Template Selection
- Pick **3–5 templates per day**
- Do not try to complete everything at once
- Consistency matters more than volume

---

### 2. CSS-Only Styling
- Apply **CSS only**
- Do **not modify the HTML structure**
- Avoid JavaScript during practice

---

### 3. Layout First
Start with structure before visuals:
- Flexbox or Grid
- Alignment
- Positioning
- Container sizing

> If the layout feels wrong, stop and fix it before moving on.

---

### 4. Add Spacing & Interactions
Once layout is solid:
- Padding & margin
- Consistent spacing (`gap` preferred)
- Hover and focus states
- Clickable touch targets

---

### 5. Make It Responsive
- Start **mobile-first**
- Stack → split patterns
- Use media queries only when necessary
- Avoid over-engineering breakpoints

---

### 6. Time Yourself
- Start with **15 minutes per template**
- Gradually reduce time as you improve
- Speed is a skill — train it intentionally

---

### 7. Repeat Weekly
- Rebuild the same templates every week
- Aim to:
  - Write less CSS
  - Make faster decisions
  - Rely less on Google

> Repetition builds intuition. Intuition builds speed.

---

## 🎯 Goal

By following this process, you will:
- Recognize ecommerce UI patterns instantly
- Debug CSS issues faster
- Build Shopify / Hydrogen UIs with confidence
- Think like a professional ecommerce UI engineer

---

## The 3 CSS buckets:

- Layout → display, flex, grid, positioning
- Spacing → margin, padding, gap
- Visuals → color, font, border, shadow

My process: layout -> spacing -> visuals -> interaction -> responsiveness

Never mix them mentally.

Happy practicing 🚀
